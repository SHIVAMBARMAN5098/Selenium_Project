# Selenium_Project

Built a modular test automation framework using Java, Selenium WebDriver, and TestNG.  
Implemented Page Object Model (POM) design for better scalability.  
Executed functional test cases like login, product search, cart flow, and checkout.  
Integrated Maven for build, and Extent Reports for detailed test logs with screenshots.  
Logged all test events for traceability and easier debugging.
